# FastHodFitting

A repository to keep track of updates and changes to my code which will be used to fit HOD parameters for projects within DESI

The method of fitting HOD parameters is based on taking paircounts from the halo catalog binned by mass, then reweighting these paircounts according to the HOD parameters.

With this method the HOD parameter space can be explored very efficiently and HOD parameters which produce a target clustering can be found quickly

Uses Corrfunc, emcee, and hdf5
